# Kisaan-Mitr - HACK4TKM
Many farmers face barriers in accessing information, listing their products, and understanding government schemes due to language and technological constraints. The lack of a user-friendly platform in their native language hinders effective communication and resource utilization. This project aims to address these challenges by developing an AI-powered agricultural assistant accessible through WhatsApp, allowing farmers to interact seamlessly in their native language. The system will facilitate product listing, provide information on government schemes, and offer assistance in diagnosing plant diseases through image uploads, creating an inclusive and efficient solution for farmers.
